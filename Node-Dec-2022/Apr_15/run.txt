await
The await operator is used to wait for a Promise and get its fulfillment value. It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module.

Syntax
await expression
Copy to Clipboard
Parameters
expression
A Promise, a thenable object, or any value to wait for.

Return value
The fulfillment value of the promise or thenable object, or, if the expression is not thenable, the expression's own value.

Exceptions
Throws the rejection reason if the promise or thenable object is rejected.

Description
await is usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression. Using await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected). When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.

If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

The expression is resolved in the same way as Promise.resolve(): it's always converted to a native Promise and then awaited. If the expression is a:

Native Promise (which means expression belongs to Promise or a subclass, and expression.constructor === Promise): The promise is directly used and awaited natively, without calling then().
Thenable object (including non-native promises, polyfill, proxy, child class, etc.): A new promise is constructed with the natiSkip to main content

The fulfillment value of the promise or thenable object, or, if the expression is not thenable, the expression's own value.

Exceptions
Throws the rejection reason if the promise or thenable object is rejected.

Description
await is usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression. Using await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected). When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.

If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

The expression is resolved in the same way as Promise.resolve(): it's always converted to a native Promise and then awaited. If the expression is a:

Native Promise (which means expression belongs to Promise or a subclass, and expression.constructor === Promise): The promise is directly used and awaited natively, without calling then().
Thenable object (including non-native promises, polyfill, proxy, child class, etc.): A new promise is constructed with the natiSkip to main content

await
The await operator is used to wait for a Promise and get its fulfillment value. It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module.

Syntax
await expression
Copy to Clipboard
Parameters
expression
A Promise, a thenable object, or any value to wait for.

Return value
The fulfillment value of the promise or thenable object, or, if the expression is not thenable, the expression's own value.

Exceptions
Throws the rejection reason if the promise or thenable object is rejected.

Description
await is usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression. Using await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected). When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.

If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

The expression is resolved in the same way as Promise.resolve(): it's always converted to a native Promise and then awaited. If the expression is a:

Native Promise (which means expression belongs to Promise or a subclass, and expression.constructor === Promise): The promise is directly used and awaited natively, without calling then().
Thenable object (including non-native promises, polyfill, proxy, child class, etc.): A new promise is constructed with the natiSkip to main content

await
The await operator is used to wait for a Promise and get its fulfillment value. It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module.

Syntax
await expression
Copy to Clipboard
Parameters
expression
A Promise, a thenable object, or any value to wait for.

Return value
The fulfillment value of the promise or thenable object, or, if the expression is not thenable, the expression's own value.

Exceptions
Throws the rejection reason if the promise or thenable object is rejected.

Description
await is usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression. Using await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected). When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.

If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

The expression is resolved in the same way as Promise.resolve(): it's always converted to a native Promise and then awaited. If the expression is a:

Native Promise (which means expression belongs to Promise or a subclass, and expression.constructor === Promise): The promise is directly used and awaited natively, without calling then().
Thenable object (including non-native promises, polyfill, proxy, child class, etc.): A new promise is constructed with the natiSkip to main content

When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.

If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

The expression is resolved in the same way as Promise.resolve(): it's always converted to a native Promise and then awaited. If the expression is a:

Native Promise (which means expression belongs to Promise or a subclass, and expression.constructor === Promise): The promise is directly used and awaited natively, without calling then().

await
The await operator is used to wait for a Promise and get its fulfillment value. It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module.

Syntax
await expression
Copy to Clipboard
Parameters
expression
A Promise, a thenable object, or any value to wait for.

Return value
The fulfillment value of the promise or thenable object, or, if the expression is not thenable, the expression's own value.

Exceptions
Throws the rejection reason if the promise or thenable object is rejected.

Description
await is usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression. Using await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected). When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.

If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

The expression is resolved in the same way as Promise.resolve(): it's always converted to a native Promise and then awaited. If the expression is a:

Native Promise (which means expression belongs to Promise or a subclass, and expression.constructor === Promise): The promise is directly used and awaited natively, without calling then().
Thenable object (including non-native promises, polyfill, proxy, child class, etc.): A new promise is constructed with the natiSkip to main content

await
The await operator is used to wait for a Promise and get its fulfillment value. It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module.

Syntax
await expression
Copy to Clipboard
Parameters
expression
A Promise, a thenable object, or any value to wait for.

Return value
The fulfillment value of the promise or thenable object, or, if the expression is not thenable, the expression's own value.

Exceptions
Throws the rejection reason if the promise or thenable object is rejected.

Description
await is usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression. Using await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected). When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.

If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

The expression is resolved in the same way as Promise.resolve(): it's always converted to a native Promise and then awaited. If the expression is a:

Native Promise (which means expression belongs to Promise or a subclass, and expression.constructor === Promise): The promise is directly used and awaited natively, without calling then().
Thenable object (including non-native promises, polyfill, proxy, child class, etc.): A new promise is constructed with the natiSkip to main content

await
The await operator is used to wait for a Promise and get its fulfillment value. It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module.

Syntax
await expression
Copy to Clipboard
Parameters
expression
A Promise, a thenable object, or any value to wait for.

Return value
The fulfillment value of the promise or thenable object, or, if the expression is not thenable, the expression's own value.

Exceptions
Throws the rejection reason if the promise or thenable object is rejected.

Description
await is usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression. Using await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected). When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.

If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

The expression is resolved in the same way as Promise.resolve(): it's always converted to a native Promise and then awaited. If the expression is a:

await
The await operator is used to wait for a Promise and get its fulfillment value. It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module.

Syntax
await expression
Copy to Clipboard
Parameters
expression
A Promise, a thenable object, or any value to wait for.

Return value
The fulfillment value of the promise or thenable object, or, if the expression is not thenable, the expression's own value.

Exceptions
Throws the rejection reason if the promise or thenable object is rejected.

Description
await is usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression. Using await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected). When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.

If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

The expression is resolved in the same way as Promise.resolve(): it's always converted to a native Promise and then awaited. If the expression is a:

Native Promise (which means expression belongs to Promise or a subclass, and expression.constructor === Promise): The promise is directly used and awaited natively, without calling then().
Thenable object (including non-native promises, polyfill, proxy, child class, etc.): A new promise is constructed with the natiSkip to main content

await
The await operator is used to wait for a Promise and get its fulfillment value. It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module.

Syntax
await expression
Copy to Clipboard
Parameters
expression
A Promise, a thenable object, or any value to wait for.

Return value
The fulfillment value of the promise or thenable object, or, if the expression is not thenable, the expression's own value.

Exceptions
Throws the rejection reason if the promise or thenable object is rejected.

Description
await is usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression. Using await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected). When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.

If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

The expression is resolved in the same way as Promise.resolve(): it's always converted to a native Promise and then awaited. If the expression is a:

Native Promise (which means expression belongs to Promise or a subclass, and expression.constructor === Promise): The promise is directly used and awaited natively, without calling then().
Thenable object (including non-native promises, polyfill, proxy, child class, etc.): A new promise is constructed with the natiSkip to main content

await
The await operator is used to wait for a Promise and get its fulfillment value. It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module.

Syntax
await expression
Copy to Clipboard
Parameters
expression
A Promise, a thenable object, or any value to wait for.

Return value
The fulfillment value of the promise or thenable object, or, if the expression is not thenable, the expression's own value.

Exceptions
Throws the rejection reason if the promise or thenable object is rejected.

Description
await is usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression. Using await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected). When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.

If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

The expression is resolved in the same way as Promise.resolve(): it's always converted to a native Promise and then awaited. If the expression is a:

Native Promise (which means expression belongs to Promise or a subclass, and expression.constructor === Promise): The promise is directly used and awaited natively, without calling then().

await
The await operator is used to wait for a Promise and get its fulfillment value. It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module.

Syntax
await expression
Copy to Clipboard
Parameters
expression
A Promise, a thenable object, or any value to wait for.

Return value
The fulfillment value of the promise or thenable object, or, if the expression is not thenable, the expression's own value.

Exceptions
Throws the rejection reason if the promise or thenable object is rejected.

Description
await is usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression. Using await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected). When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.

If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

The expression is resolved in the same way as Promise.resolve(): it's always converted to a native Promise and then awaited. If the expression is a:

Native Promise (which means expression belongs to Promise or a subclass, and expression.constructor === Promise): The promise is directly used and awaited natively, without calling then().
Thenable object (including non-native promises, polyfill, proxy, child class, etc.): A new promise is constructed with the natiSkip to main content

await
The await operator is used to wait for a Promise and get its fulfillment value. It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module.

Syntax
await expression
Copy to Clipboard
Parameters
expression
A Promise, a thenable object, or any value to wait for.

Return value
The fulfillment value of the promise or thenable object, or, if the expression is not thenable, the expression's own value.

Exceptions
Throws the rejection reason if the promise or thenable object is rejected.

Description
await is usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression. Using await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected). When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.

If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

The expression is resolved in the same way as Promise.resolve(): it's always converted to a native Promise and then awaited. If the expression is a:

Native Promise (which means expression belongs to Promise or a subclass, and expression.constructor === Promise): The promise is directly used and awaited natively, without calling then().
Thenable object (including non-native promises, polyfill, proxy, child class, etc.): A new promise is constructed with the natiSkip to main content

await
The await operator is used to wait for a Promise and get its fulfillment value. It can only be used inside an async function or at the top level of a module.

Syntax
await expression
Copy to Clipboard
Parameters
expression
A Promise, a thenable object, or any value to wait for.

Return value
The fulfillment value of the promise or thenable object, or, if the expression is not thenable, the expression's own value.

Exceptions
Throws the rejection reason if the promise or thenable object is rejected.

Description
await is usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression. Using await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected). When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise.

If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

The expression is resolved in the same way as Promise.resolve(): it's always converted to a native Promise and then awaited. If the expression is a:

Native Promise (which means expression belongs to Promise or a subclass, and expression.constructor === Promise): The promise is directly used and awaited natively, without calling then().
