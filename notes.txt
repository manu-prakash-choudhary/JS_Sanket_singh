                                  Intro to JS

There set of types in js are two : primitive values and objects

---> Primitive values.(immutable datum)
    . String
    . Boolean
    . Null
    . Undefined
    . Number 
    . BigInt
    . Symbol

console.log(typeof <value>) //will return type of the value
console.log(typeof "hello_world") //will return string
console.log(typeof 12) //will return number
console.log(typeof null) //will return object   //Corner Case
console.log(typeof Undefined) //will return Undefined

In js string can be written with backticks as well
// console.log(`Hey there wassup`)  backticks string example,

Objects in js are made up of key value pairs
JS treats 0 and -0 differently.


--->Variables in JS

Three ways to initialize variables in JS
    . let
    . const
    . var
everyone one of them has there own use cases


---> Operators in JS
            Airthmetic Operators
                +,-,*,/,%

            Assignment Operators
                =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=

            Logical Operators
                Logical AND = &&
                Logical OR = ||
                Logical NOT = !

            Comparision Operators
                >,>=,<=,<,!=,==,===,!==
                "!=" : abstract not equal to
                "!=="  : strict not equal to
                "==" : absttract equal to 
                "===" : strict equal to
            String based Operators
                + : Concatenate Operator
            Bitwise Operator
                Bitwise AND : &
                Bitwise OR : |
                Bitwise XOR : ^
                Bitwise NOT : ~
                left shift : <<   //4<<1 = 8
                right shift : >>  //8>>1 = 4
            Ternary Operator(not a basic Operator)
                ?: = (condition)?(expression 1):(expression 2)
                if true then expression1 else expression 2
